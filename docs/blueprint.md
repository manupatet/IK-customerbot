# **App Name**: ProductAssist

## Core Features:

- Product Catalog Initialization: Loads a list of products with attributes such as name and features from a local JSON file into memory. The schema should be easily extensible to other product attributes without code changes.
- AI-Powered Customer Chat: Uses a suitable LLM with LangChain to generate informative and helpful responses to customer inquiries. If necessary, this feature incorporates an embeddings-based product lookup tool to find the right products from the catalog, and inform the response. The response indicates how certain the tool is about which piece of product information is helpful
- Web Chat Interface: Provides a web-based chat interface where customers can type questions and receive responses from the support bot.
- User Authentication: Enables users to create accounts using a simple email/password combination, storing user credentials locally to support personalized sessions.
- Contextual Chat Memory: Maintains per-user session memory using LangChainâ€™s memory module, ensuring context is preserved across multiple chat turns, as appropriate for the specific questions the user is asking. Uses conversation summarization and question contextualization for a better chat experience.
